# Machine Learning Notebooks
Collection of notebooks that I have worked upon in topics related to machine learning

## Notebooks

1. UCI Heart Disease Detection: Given a set of features, detect whether the patient has heart disease or not. Worked with Random Forest and Decision Trees here. Good starter notebook for anyone who wants to see how to approach a ml problem from end-to-end.

2. Anomaly Detection For NYC Taxi Dataset: Given 30-minute timestampes with number of passengers in NYC cabs for 2014-2015, detect the outliers. extensive feature engineering and EDA. Good starter notebook for anyone who wants to see how feature engineering works for time-series data. 

## Future Scope

1. Anomaly Detection For NYC Taxi Dataset: Isolation Forest can be tweaked for better results. There is scope to experiment with clustering algorithms.
